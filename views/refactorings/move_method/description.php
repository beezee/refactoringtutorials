<?php $this->beginWidget('CMarkdown'); ?>
###Move a method from one class to another

This is another very common refactoring which can be used to control the length and focus of your classes. When a class appears to be doing too much, or is getting too tightly coupled, it's time to consider what of it's methods are a good candidate to pick up and migrate elsewhere.

<?php $this->endWidget();
