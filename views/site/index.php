###Interactive tutorials based on common refactorings

The refactorings on the left are taken from Martin Fowlers catalog and roughly follow the examples
given in his book ["Refactoring: Ruby Edition"](http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html).

Each tutorial will walk you through several steps focused on getting you acquainted with a
specific refactoring in circumstances with varying levels of difficulty.

Choose a refactoring from the left to get started.
